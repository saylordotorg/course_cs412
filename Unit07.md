**Unit 7: Mobile Application Evaluation and Mobile Browsers** <span
id="7"></span> 
*Once a mobile application has been developed, you will want to test it
for usability.  In this unit, we will talk about ways of evaluating
mobile apps.  We will also look at the differences between traditional
browsers and mobile browsers and identify the elements that must be
taken into consideration when designing an application for deployment on
a mobile browser.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 4 hours and 50 minutes to complete.
