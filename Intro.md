Course Syllabus for "CS412: Mobile Applications Development"
------------------------------------------------------------

Technology continues to evolve and provide us with increasingly powerful
mobile devices.  As a result, applications that can run on a browser
must also be written such that they are compatible with mobile devices,
the majority of which are now web-enabled.  Meanwhile, there is an
increasing demand for native applications that can be downloaded to and
run on mobile devices.  This course will address these trends, teaching
you to think about the unique design and deployment issues that must be
taken into consideration when developing applications for mobile
devices. This course will expand upon what has been covered in [CS305:
Web Development](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs305/).  We will
specifically look at the tools used to design mobile applications.  We
will learn about mobile platforms, mobile browsers, native applications,
and best practices in terms of test usability.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Define mobile computing and the types of mobile devices.
-   Detail the history of mobile computing.
-   Explain the basic theory behind networks and cellular networks.
-   Write HTML and JavaScript code for mobile devices.
-   Discuss user interface design considerations.
-   Explain the differences between HTML5 and HTML.
-   Develop apps for Android devices.
-   Develop apps for IOS devices.

### Course Information

Welcome to CS412!  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designe**r: John Russo  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   UC Berkeley: Erik Wilde’s “Mobile Application Design and
    Development”
-   YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology: S. Ghosh’s  “Networking”
-   The NewBoston Education: JavaScript Tutorial
-   W3Schools.com
-   Eurocom Sophia-Antipolis: Navid Nikaein’s Mobile Applications and
    Services: Design and Development Course
-   Harvard University OpenCourseWare: Computer Science E-76

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in later
units.   
    
 You will also need to complete a Final Exam.  Please note that you will
only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.  In order to “pass”
the course, you must receive a grade of **70%** or higher on the Final
Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course will take approximately **105 hours**
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 takes 8 hours to complete.  Perhaps you
could sit down with your calendar and plan to complete the introduction
through subunit 1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday and Tuesday evenings,
subunit 1.3 (a total of 45 minutes) on Wednesday evening, and so
forth.
