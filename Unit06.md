**Unit 6: Designing Mobile User Interfaces** <span id="6"></span> 
*Since mobile devices have screen size and memory limitations, one must
really think carefully before designing a user interface.  In this unit,
we will discuss usability, learning how to ascertain what the user needs
through task and contextual analysis.  We will then apply this
information as we discuss various approaches to building good user
interfaces.  The unit will also cover rapid prototyping and testing and
will explain how all of the traditional UI design principles apply—to
some degree—to mobile application development as well.  Finally, we will
look at the different types of user interfaces for mobile devices.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 13 hours and 30 minutes to complete.
